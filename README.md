# Livewire pagination

This whole thing is to just figure out Livewire pagination in a clean environment. Mostly because I must of missed something in one of my projects 🤷‍♂️.

Built with the TALL stack (Tailwind, AlpineJS, Livewire and Laravel).

Oh and one more thing, search uses [lorisleiva/laravel-search-string](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-search-string) because it's sweet. So this means you can do things 🧙‍♂️ like `'dr.' or 'mrs.' sort:name`.
